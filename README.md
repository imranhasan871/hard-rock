<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![hard-rock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33188928/180201552-325a2ff6-efa1-4602-81fc-9d5271d50e30.png)

There are many ways to describe a project. This is one of them. It's a project that I've been working on for a while. This is a Food Searching App. I've been working on this for a while and I'm very happy with the result. I hope you enjoy it. I hope you find it useful. I use API to search for food.

Here's why:

-   I'm a developer and I love to code. I love to create things. I love to make things. I love to make things that people can use.:smile:

-

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
